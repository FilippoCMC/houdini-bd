            <div class="right-col">
                <p>Bipolar disorder is a common mental health condition characterized by significant shifts in mood, energy, and sleep patterns during recurring episodes, interspersed with periods of relative stability. One of the main challenges in care is that changes in mood, energy, and sleep often begin between clinic visits, while patients struggle to recognise and report their symptoms. This makes new episodes difficult to detect and address early, leading to worse outcomes.</p>

                <p><strong>The "Blood Sugar" Analogy</strong><br>
                At present, there is no simple, objective test for monitoring bipolar disorder—nothing comparable to the finger-prick blood sugar test used in diabetes care. As a result, early warning signs can be missed, thus limiting opportunities for timely support or intervention.</p>

                <p><strong>A Modern Solution</strong><br>
                Smart wristbands (such as smartwatches) offer a potential way to bridge this gap. By tracking sleep and activity levels continuously and with minimal effort, they provide an ongoing view of everyday patterns. Subtle changes in these rhythms may signal that a person’s mental state is beginning to shift.</p>

                <p><strong>The HOUDINI-BD Mission</strong><br>
                HOUDINI-BD will be exploring whether this type of technology can be a practical and reliable way to support the monitoring of bipolar disorder in daily life. The study is observational and does not provide diagnosis or treatment. We focus on two main areas:</p>

                    If so, you may be eligible to take part in our study. Please take our 
                    <a href="#screening-box">5-minute questionnaire below</a> 
                    to help us find out if you are eligible. By wearing a smart wristband in your day-to-day life, you would help us develop solutions to spot early signs of new bipolar episodes and improve future care. As a thank you for your contribution, you will receive <strong>£30.00</strong> after each study appointment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you decide to take part, you are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason. A decision to withdraw at any time, or a decision not to take part, will not affect the standard of care you are receiving, now or in the future.

                </div>

                <p>Below is an overview of the study procedures and how we handle your data. Please refer to the downloadable <a href="static/documents/participant_information_sheet.pdf" target="_blank">Participant Information Sheet</a> for further details.

                <h3 class="section-subheading">What can I expect if I take part?</h3>
                
                <p>If you are eligible after screening and choose to participate, we will arrange a baseline appointment (60–70 minutes) with you at 
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=West+London+NHS+Trust+1+Armstrong+Way+Southall+UB2+4SD" target="_blank">
                        West London NHS Trust, 1 Armstrong Way, Southall UB2 4SD
                    </a>. During the baseline appointment, you will have a chance to ask any questions you may have about the study. If you decide to take part, we will ask you to sign a consent form and we will collect some information about your mental health history and demographics (e.g. age, sex, occupation). You will also complete a brief speech task (5 minutes) where you will be asked to speak about neutral topics. This will be audio-recorded using a secure system. We will then provide you with a smart wristband (<a href="#wristband-detail">further details below</a> ) to wear on your nondominant wrist over the next 12 months in your daily life. We will periodically send you (over email or text message) reminders to wear and recharge the wristband. Following the baseline appointment, you will receive your first £30.00 payment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You will then receive a link to download the MindCraft app from the App Store or Play Store (<a href="#mindcraft-detail">further details below</a> ), along with a unique login. You will only use the MindCraft app during the first four weeks of the study in addition to wearing the wristband. This app runs in the background, tracking things like steps and general noise levels. Additionally, it will prompt you to answer a few short questions, twice daily, about your mood and sleep. Furthermore, you will receive brief (3-5 minute) phone calls - weekly, over the first four weeks - from an automated speech agent (<a href="#agent-detail">further details below</a> ). This agent will enquire about your wellbeing and health and record speech samples with a secure system. You will no longer engage with the MindCraft app or the speech agent after the first four weeks of the study. <em>You can <a href="#contact">contact the research team</a> at any point if you have queries about the study or need assistance with the MindCraft app, the automated speech agent, or the wristband</em>.
                </p>

                <p>To see how you are getting on, we will meet for four short follow-up appointments (30–40 minutes) every three months, in the same location as the baseline appointment, over the course of the 12-month study. You will receive £30.00 after each appointment (totalling <strong>£150.00</strong> over the course of the entire study, including the baseline appointment). If you withdraw from the study before completing it, you will retain any payments given up to that point. During these follow-up appointments, we will download data collected in-between appointments with the wristband. We will use a questionnaire to determine whether any bipolar episode took place in between assessments or is ongoing. We will ask you about your experience with the wristband. Lastly, you will also complete a brief speech task (5 minutes) similar to the one completed at the baseline appointment. Speech from the speech task and your feedback on the wristband will be securely recorded for analysis. No other speech data will be recorded during the follow-up appointments.</p>

            <h4 class="tech-title">Wristband</h4>
            <p>You will use the Axivity AX6 wristband. This is a small, water-resistant wristband designed to measure everyday activity and sleep. It has been widely used across various research studies.</p> 
            <p> The wristband uses built-in motion, light, and temperature sensors to track patterns of activity and rest. From this information, we can estimate things like activity levels and sleep–wake patterns, and also check whether the device was being worn.</p>
            <p>The AX6 records data securely on the device itself and does not send information in real time. You do not need to install any apps on your smartphone to use the AX6 wristband. We will download the data during your follow-up visits.</p> 
            <p>With the study settings, a full charge takes approximately two hours and the battery lasts about three months. So, you will usually only need to recharge the device once between quarterly follow-up visits. When we contact you to remind you about an upcoming visit, we will also remind you to recharge the wristband.</p>
            <p>To help you remember to wear the device, we will send reminders by text message or email. While we encourage you to keep the wristband on as much as you can, you can remove it at any time and put it back on if you wish.</p>

                <p>MindCraft was developed by the Brain & Behaviour Lab, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, in collaboration with Lived Experience Experts.</p>
                <p>It is a user-friendly app designed to passively collect data from smartphone sensors (e.g. step count, environment noise, or location). You will set your data-sharing preferences when you first set up the app, and you can change them at any time in the app’s settings. For example, if you feel uncomfortable sharing a particular type of data, such as GPS location or environmental noise, you can choose to exclude it, and this will not prevent you from continuing in the study.</p>
                <p>MindCraft will also prompt you twice daily to respond to brief questions about your mental health (e.g. sleep and mood).</p>

                <p>During the first four weeks of the study, you will receive a weekly automated phone call lasting about 3–5 minutes. During each call, a secure computer system will ask a few simple, structured questions about your mood, wellbeing, symptoms, and daily activities. Your responses will be audio-recorded for research purposes only.</p>
                <p>The automated phone calls use a secure computer system that asks short, structured questions about your mood, wellbeing, and daily activities. The system is designed to stay on topic and does not give medical advice or make clinical decisions. The technology is based on Google’s conversational AI, but strict agreements ensure that Google cannot access or use the conversation data, including for training AI systems.</p>

                <p>To carry out this research, we will need to use information collected from you while you take part in the study.</p>

                <p><strong>What information we will collect</strong><br>
                This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your name and contact details</li>
                    <li>Health and background information, such as the number of past bipolar episodes, current medications, and your answers to questionnaires</li>
                    <li>Information collected through the MindCraft app</li>
                    <li>Data from the Axivity AX6 wristband</li>

                </ul>

                <p><strong>Who will use this information</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Members of the study team and authorised staff at Imperial College London will use this information to carry out the research.</li>
                    <li>Some staff may also check records to make sure the study is being run properly and that contact details are correct.</li>
                    <li>People who do not need to know who you are will not see your name or contact details.</li>
                    <li>Wherever possible, your data will be labelled with a code number instead of your name.</li>
                    <li>Imperial College London is the sponsor of this research and is responsible for keeping your information safe.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>How we keep your information safe</strong><br>
                We use a range of secure systems and procedures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Screening questionnaires are collected using Qualtrics, a system that complies with UK GDPR rules. Data are stored on secure Qualtrics servers and then transferred to Imperial College servers. Once transferred, the data are deleted from Qualtrics. If someone does not meet the study criteria or decides not to take part, their data will be destroyed.</li>
                    <li>Personal identifiable information (such as consent forms and contact details) is stored in locked cabinets at the study sites.</li>
                    <li>Phone calls between you and the research team (for example, to ask questions or arrange appointments) are not recorded.</li>
                    <li>Clinical and background information is stored securely using REDCap, a GDPR-compliant research database.</li>
                    <li>Speech recordings are handled securely:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In-person recordings are stored using encrypted, HIPAA-compliant software.</li>
                            <li>Automated phone calls use a secure, encrypted system.</li>
                            <li>These systems are designed so that audio data cannot be used for other purposes, including training artificial intelligence systems.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>AX6 wristband data are downloaded during follow-up visits onto an Imperial College-owned laptop and then uploaded to a secure Imperial College server.</li>
                    <li>MindCraft app data (such as app use and behaviour data) are sent directly to a secure server located within Imperial College London.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Sharing anonymised data (optional)</strong><br>
                You can choose whether or not your anonymised data may be shared publicly by selecting the relevant option on the consent form. If you agree:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your data will be shared without any information that identifies you.</li>
                    <li>Sharing anonymised data helps make research more transparent and allows other researchers to build on the findings.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>To reduce the risk that someone could identify you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time stamps from the AX6 wristband will be shifted slightly, and data will be resampled.</li>
                    <li>Information on ethnicity and employment will only be shared in grouped form across all participants.</li>
                    <li>Age will be shared in 5-year bands (for example, 21–25 rather than a specific age).</li>
                    <li>Location data from your smartphone, if collected through the MindCraft app, will not be shared.</li>
                    <li>Voice recordings will not be shared; only anonymised text transcripts may be shared.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We aim to recruit around 40 participants. As the HOUDINI-BD study progresses, we will herewith share updates on the study population (e.g. total number of participants joined, hours of wristband data recorded, cohort age and sex distribution, etc...) and research findings.</p>

                <p><strong>Participants' Personalized Summary</strong><br>
                To keep participants informed about their contribution, we will email them with a personalized summary of their sleep-wake patterns and energy levels as recorded by their wristband. This summary is intended to help particiapants better understand their sleep-wake and energy levels patterns; it is provided for information only and does not constitute medical advice.</p>
