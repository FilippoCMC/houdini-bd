                <p><strong>How do I use the wristband?</strong><br>
                During your baseline appointment, the research team will provide you with a fully charged and ready-to-use Axivity AX6 wristband. Using the wristband does not require any special setup; simply put it on your non-dominant wrist, as shown in the image below:</p>

                </figure>
                <p> Please wear the wristband during your daily life for the duration of the study. To help you remember, we will send reminders via text message. Every hour of data helps us better understand the rest-activity patterns associated with bipolar disorder. Of course, feel free to remove the wristband at any point if you feel discomfort. The wristband is water-resistant, so you can keep it on while showering or washing your hands; however, we recommend taking it off for swimming or diving.</p>
                <p> The Axivity AX6 is made of a skin-safe, soft-touch silicone material with stainless steel fastenings. The wristband features a cavity on the rear that allows for easy insertion and removal of the data logger—no tools are required. This logger collects data on your movement, energy levels (acceleration), ambient light, and temperature. Your data is not streamed to the research team in real time. We will securely download it from the device at your follow-up appointments.</p>

                <p><strong>How do I charge the wristband?</strong><br>
                You only need to recharge the wristband once between your quarterly follow-up appointments. When scheduling these visits, the research team will send you a text message to remind you to charge the device. We will also ensure the wristband is fully charged during each appointment.</p>
                <p>To charge the AX6, you must remove the data logger from the silicone wristband. The research team will demonstrate how to do this during your baseline appointment—it is a simple process and requires no tools. A instructional video is also available below. Once the data logger is removed, please plug it into a Micro USB cable. Any Micro USB cable will work; if you do not have a Micro USB cable, the research team will provide you with one during the baseline appointment. The video below demonstrates how to charge the device.</p>

                <p><strong>How do I know the wristband is charged?</strong><br>
                When the device is connected to a power source (such as a wall plug) via a Micro USB cable, a red LED will light up to indicate it is charging (see video above). After approximately two hours, a green LED will appear, indicating that the charge is complete. Once the device is charged, please put it back on your non-dominant wrist.During your follow-up appointments, we will verify the battery status while acquiring your data.</p>
